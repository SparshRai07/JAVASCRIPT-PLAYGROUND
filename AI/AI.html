<!-- Computational Power 
refers to the ability of a computer system to process and solve complex problems at high speeds. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), computational power is crucial because it determines how quickly and effectively an AI system can learn from data, make decisions, and perform tasks.

Connection with AI:
 AI involves tasks such as processing large datasets, recognizing patterns, and making predictions. These tasks require significant computational resources, especially as AI models become more complex. Higher computational power allows AI systems to train on larger datasets more quickly, improve their accuracy, and execute tasks more efficiently. This is particularly important in fields like deep learning, where neural networks with many layers require vast amounts of computational power to simulate and process. -->

 <!-- Blockchain Technology   
   is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This technology ensures the integrity and transparency of data without a central authority. -->

 <!-- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
       are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework. This technique can generate photographs that look authentic to human observers, among other tasks.

 <!-- Natural Language Processing (NLP) -->
 <!-- NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and digital devices to recognize, understand, and generate text and speech. -->
<!-- It combines computational linguistics (rule-based modeling of human language) with statistical and machine learning models. -->


<!-- Artificial General Intelligence -->
<!-- AGI refers to AI systems that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks and domains.
Unlike specialized AI, AGI exhibits cognitive flexibility, adaptability, and general problem-solving skills.
It aims to replicate human-like intelligence and reasoning -->

<!-- CONCIOUSNESS -->

<!-- Consciousness is the awareness of both internal and external existence.
It encompasses our perception of self, surroundings, and mental states.
Philosophers, theologians, and scientists have debated its nature for centuries1 -->
