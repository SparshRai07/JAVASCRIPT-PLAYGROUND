<!-- Computational Power 
refers to the ability of a computer system to process and solve complex problems at high speeds. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), computational power is crucial because it determines how quickly and effectively an AI system can learn from data, make decisions, and perform tasks.

Connection with AI:
 AI involves tasks such as processing large datasets, recognizing patterns, and making predictions. These tasks require significant computational resources, especially as AI models become more complex. Higher computational power allows AI systems to train on larger datasets more quickly, improve their accuracy, and execute tasks more efficiently. This is particularly important in fields like deep learning, where neural networks with many layers require vast amounts of computational power to simulate and process. -->
