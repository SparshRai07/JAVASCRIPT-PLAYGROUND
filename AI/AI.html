<!-- Computational Power 
refers to the ability of a computer system to process and solve complex problems at high speeds. In the context of artificial intelligence (AI), computational power is crucial because it determines how quickly and effectively an AI system can learn from data, make decisions, and perform tasks.

Connection with AI:
 AI involves tasks such as processing large datasets, recognizing patterns, and making predictions. These tasks require significant computational resources, especially as AI models become more complex. Higher computational power allows AI systems to train on larger datasets more quickly, improve their accuracy, and execute tasks more efficiently. This is particularly important in fields like deep learning, where neural networks with many layers require vast amounts of computational power to simulate and process. -->

 <!-- Blockchain Technology   
   is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This technology ensures the integrity and transparency of data without a central authority. -->

 <!-- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
       are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework. This technique can generate photographs that look authentic to human observers, among other tasks.

 <!-- Natural Language Processing (NLP) -->
 <!-- NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and digital devices to recognize, understand, and generate text and speech. -->
<!-- It combines computational linguistics (rule-based modeling of human language) with statistical and machine learning models. -->


<!-- Artificial General Intelligence -->
<!-- AGI refers to AI systems that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks and domains.
Unlike specialized AI, AGI exhibits cognitive flexibility, adaptability, and general problem-solving skills.
It aims to replicate human-like intelligence and reasoning -->

<!-- CONCIOUSNESS -->

<!-- Consciousness is the awareness of both internal and external existence.
It encompasses our perception of self, surroundings, and mental states.
Philosophers, theologians, and scientists have debated its nature for centuries1 -->

<!-- Reinforcement Learning -->
<!-- Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an algorithm to learn by interacting with an environment using a system of rewards and punishments. Reinforcement learning is distinguished by its ability to make sequences of decisions; the agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain, potentially complex environment.
 -->

 <!-- Connection with AI: -->
<!-- In reinforcement learning, an AI agent makes observations and takes actions within an environment and receives rewards in response to the actions it takes. This method is very powerful in teaching the agent to learn the best actions to take in a given environment over time. RL is used extensively in robotics, gaming, navigation, and scenarios where decision-making is critical, such as in autonomous driving. -->

<!-- Prompt Engineering -->
<!-- Prompt Engineering is a field within artificial intelligence focused on crafting inputs (prompts) that effectively communicate tasks or queries to AI models, particularly those based on language like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). The goal is to elicit the best possible outputs from the AI. -->

<!-- Prompt engineering involves understanding the nuances of how AI models interpret language and using this understanding to design prompts that guide the AI to interpret and generate responses most effectively. It's partly an art and partly a science, requiring both creativity and systematic experimentation. -->


<!-- Computer Vision -->
<!-- Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects, and then react to what they “see.” -->
<!-- Computer vision algorithms often use pattern recognition and learning techniques to recognize faces, objects, scenes, and actions in images and videos. 
this capability is critical in numerous applications, including:
Autonomous Vechicles
Facial Recognition
Industrial Robots-->

<!-- Extended Reality (XR) -->
<!-- Extended Reality (XR) is an umbrella term that covers various forms of immersive technologies including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), which merge the real and virtual worlds to create new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time. -->
