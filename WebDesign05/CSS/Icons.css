/* -Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icons pack 
   -Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from diferent icon packs
   -Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don't use butmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!
   -Adjust to website personlaity! Roundness, weight and filled/outlined depend on typography
   -Use icons to provide visual assistance to text
   -Use icons for product feature blocks
   -Use icons associated with actions, label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)
   -Use icons as bullet points
   -To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, use different color
   -Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action!
   -Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. if needed, enclose them in a shape
