      - Choose the right typeface according to your websote personality. */

    /* -When choosing font-size, limit choices! Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range 
       -Use a font size between 16pv and 32px fr "normal" text
       -For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
       -for headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), depending on personality
       -for any text, dont use a font weight under 400(regular) */

  /* CREATE A GOOD READING EXPERIENCE */

    /* -for normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5 */
    /* -Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural (this will come from experience) */
