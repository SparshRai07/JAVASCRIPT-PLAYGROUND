/* WHY WHITESPACE */

/* -The right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean, modern and polished
   -Whitespace communicates how different pieces of information are related to one another 
   -Whitespace implies invisible relatonships between the elements of a layout



   /* WHERE TO USE WHITESPACE

   -Use tons of whitespace between sections
   -Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements
   -Use whitespace between elements
   -Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines
   -The more some elements (or group of elements) belong together, the close they should be!
   -Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much! then remove whitespace from there 
     âœŒ-Too much whitespace looks detached, too little looks too crammed 
   -Match other design choices. if you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace
   -Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing
