UX RULES FOR USABILITY

1-Don't design complicated layouts. Don't       reinvent the wheel. Use patterns that users know

2-Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make the text descriptive

3-Use blut text and underlined text only for links!

4-Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200 and 500 ms

5-In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form easier to scan

6- Offer users good feedbacl for all actions: from errors, form success , etc [web apps]

7.Place action buttons where they create an effect (law of locality) [web apps]


{The Law of Locality in UX design states that users prefer information and controls to be grouped together based on their relevance and function. This means related items should be placed near each other to make the interface more intuitive and easier to use.}
