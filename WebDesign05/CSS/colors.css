/* CHOOSE THE RIGHT COLOR */
  
     /* Make the main color match your website's personality */
     /* Use a good color tone! Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors. */
     /* You need atleast two types of colors in your color palette: a main color and a grey color */
     /* with more experience, you can add more colors:accent (use a tool) */
     /* For diversity, create lighter and darker "versions" (tints and shades)  */
     /* Use your main color to draw attenton to the most important elements on the page  */
     /* Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out */
     /* You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations */
     /* On dark colored backfground, try to use a  tint of the background ("lighter version) for Text like if you use dark grey use light grey*/
     /* Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten if up it looks heavy and uninviting  */
     /*Dont make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors */
