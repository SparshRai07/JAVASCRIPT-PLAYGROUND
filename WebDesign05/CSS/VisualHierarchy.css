/* What is VISUAL HIERARCHY 
ðŸ‘‰Visual hierarchy is about establishing which elements of a design are the most important ones
ðŸ‘‰Visual hierarchy is about drawing attention to these most important elements
ðŸ‘‰Visual hierarchy is about defining a "path" for users, to huide them through the page
ðŸ‘‰We use a combination of position, size, colors, spacing, borders, and shadows to establish a meaningful visual hierarchy between elements/components



VISUAL HIERARCHY FUNDAMENTALS
-Position important elemnts closer to the top the page, where they get more attention
-Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (larger images get more attention)
-Whitespace creates seperation, so use whitespace strategically to emphasize elements
-for text elements, uae font size, font weight, color, and whitespace to convey importance
  ðŸ‘†You can also de-emphasize less important text, like labels or secondary/additional information

-Emphasize an important component using background color, shadow or border (or multiple)  
-Try emphasizing some component A over component B by de-emphasixing component B
-What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action ssections, heighlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables.
