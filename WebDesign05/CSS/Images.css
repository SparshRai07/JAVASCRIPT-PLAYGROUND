/* IMAGES AND ILLUSTRATIONS */
/* USE GOOD IMAGES */
   /* -Different types of images: product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations, patterns */
   /* Use images to support your website’s message and story. So only use 
   relevant images! 
   - Prefer original images. If not possible, use original-looking stock images 
   (not generic ones!) 
   - Try to show real people to trigger user’s emotions 
   - If necessary, crop images to fit your message 
   - Experiment combining photos, illustrations and patterns  
   - Method #1: Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a 
   gradient) 
   - Method #2: Position text into neutral image area 
   - Method #3: Put text in a box 
   - To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as 
   their displayed size 
   - Compress images for a lower file size and better performance 
   - When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact 
   same dimensions */
