/* Shadow creates depth (3D): the more shadow, the 
 away from the interface the element is */

 /*(DISTANCE FROM SCREEN/INTERFACE)  */

 /* shadows can be just both on boxs and texts */


 /* USE SHADOWS WELL */
 
 /* 1. You dont have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense for the website personality 
    2.Use shadows in small doses: dont add shadows to every element
    3.Go light on shadows, dont make them too dark!
    4.Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)
    5. Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
    6.Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface
    7.Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)
    8. Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)
